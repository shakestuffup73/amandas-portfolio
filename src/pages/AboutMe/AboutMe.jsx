      <h3>Hey there, I'm Amanda. After six years on Active Duty in the military, I decided to branch out (pun intended) and see what else life had to offer. Seeking adventure and freedom, I spent my first three years out of the service working in Outdoor Education in Washington and Maine, and then as a Federal Park Ranger in Colorado and Montana. Time in the wilderness was both healing and illuminating, affording me the space to look inwards and make intentional decisions about the person I want to be and grow to become. I have many miles and wonderful people to thank for the lessons I've learned along the way, both for whom and for which I will be forever grateful. </h3>
